  <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

  <p>It has been several months since the first novel. I, Hiroyuki Kawasaki, have been offered the important role of writing the second novel.</p>

  <p>The original manga series has already ended, which means the <em>Love Hina</em> world has concluded, but I tried to find stories to fit in between the gaps and avoid disrupting the natural flow of the original storyline.</p>

  <p>When I was a child, whenever my favorite TV series ended, I was left with a sad feeling. (This was, of course, before VCRs were invented!) If the fans of <em>Love Hina</em>, still sad from the series' conclusion, would think of these chapter as, &ldquo;I suppose this could have happened,&rdquo; it will give me the greatest pleasure.</p>
