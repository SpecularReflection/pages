  <h1>Part II: Holiday Night for the Studying Knight</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 1: Motoko&rsquo;s Secret and Kitsune&rsquo;s Lie</h2>

  <p>It was the middle of December and winter was in full force. Snow blanketed the ground.</p>

  <p>Because of crazy year-end schedules, the townspeople walked briskly, as if in a hurry to get to somewhere. Though busy, the people seemed cheery, probably because Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s parties were getting closer.</p>

  <p>But there were some people who could not enjoy the festivities no matter what. Take, for example, students studying to get into the next level of education.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, are you ready?&rdquo; Mutsumi asked</p>

  <p>Shinobu was a little nervous but quickly replied, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru started the stopwatch. &ldquo;Begin!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>It was Saturday. Naru and Mutsumi were conducting a practice test to see how well Shinobu had done with her studies. She finished in record time.</p>

  <p>Her progress was good&mdash;though there were several mistakes from hasty or inflexible responses. Still, she had the basics down, so if she worked on her weak areas, she would probably pass the entrance exam to M High.</p>

  <p>Tears welled up in Shinobu&rsquo;s eyes and she said, &ldquo;Thank you very much. If it wasn&rsquo;t the help for I received from the two of you&hellip;&rdquo; A tear rolled down her cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh my, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; Mutsumi said comfortingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Naru said. &ldquo;You still have a few more months before the big test.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Shinobu bugged Mutsumi and Naru, then wiped her tears away and said, &ldquo;Yes, I will do my best.&rdquo; She was crying out of happiness.</p>

  <p>Right then, Motoko entered the room with a textbook in her hand. &ldquo;Naru, may I borrow you for a minute?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Motoko?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how to solve this problem&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko was also studying, but she didn&rsquo;t usually get much tutoring. She came every once in a while to ask a question. This time, Naru sensed, the answer would be a good bit trickier.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the beginning of December&hellip;</p>
  <hr>

  <p><em>Naru began tutoring Shinobu, and offered to help Motoko also. But Motoko said, &ldquo;Naru, you&rsquo;re already filling in for Urashima&rsquo;s absence by being the substitute manager. On top of that, you teach at a local cram school and have your own college studies. I don&rsquo;t want to burden you by asking for help.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>Motoko had politely declined Naru&rsquo;s offer, but in truth that was just a cover. She didn&rsquo;t want Naru to find out what college she was aiming for&mdash;she was secretly applying for Todai.</em></p>

  <p><em>Back during the cherry blossom season, when Keitaro finally made it into Todai, Motoko remembered saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying to get into college, too. Since you studied for four years to get in, I&rsquo;d like to get some of your advice&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>She wasn&rsquo;t thinking about Todai then. Motoko decided to aim for Tokyo University after the incident with her older sister, Tsuruko. (Tsuruko came to have Motoko take over the Shinmei-ryu dojo, and caused a large commotion involving Naru and Keitaro, but ended up agreeing to let Motoko study for college.) After all the struggles and suffering, she had obtained her ticket to freedom. And the liberated Motoko thought if she was going to study, why not aim for the best?</em></p>

  <p><em>But she never revealed her plans to Naru and Keitaro, who were both currently students at Todai.</em></p>

  <p><em>If she had, Keitaro would probably have cheered her on. He&rsquo;d probably have said, &ldquo;You can do it, Motoko,&rdquo; or something similarly upbeat and hopeful. But Motoko knew that if Keitaro said something so gentle and sweet, her strong fa&ccedil;ade would have surely crumbled.</em></p>

  <p><em>Motoko didn&rsquo;t want to hurt Naru, because Naru would probably shout the good news to the whole world. If people found out that she was aiming for Todai, Kitsune would probably tease her and say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going after Keitaro.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t want that to happen, since Naru was someone she looked up to and admired, and Motoko didn&rsquo;t want to cause a fight between Naru and Keitaro.</em></p>

  <p><em>Which, just before sundown, is exactly what happened.</em></p>

  <p><em>To make matter even more tense, Shinobu was hanging &ldquo;I want to go to Todai!&rdquo; wish tags on bamboo sticks and got horribly teased by Kitsune and the other girls.</em></p>

  <p><em>Motoko said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have high goals!&rdquo; She was ostensibly defending Shinobu, but she was defending herself, too.</em></p>

  <p><em>If Shinobu was merely laughed at, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been too bad, but Suu had actually tried to reconfigure the poor girl&rsquo;s brain! After seeing Shinobu treated with so little respect, and how easily Naru and Keitaro could quarrel, Motoko vowed not to tell anyone which college she wanted to attend.</em></p>
  <hr>

  <p>And up until now, Motoko&rsquo;s secret had remained&mdash;well, a secret. But that was all about to change.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&hellip; Motoko, are you listening?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Motoko stared blankly up from her textbook. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I was trying to listen to your explanation, but I lost my concentration and my mind went elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In other words, she had no idea what Naru had said. Motoko slumped her shoulders.</p>

  <p>Naru tried to comfort her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay; this problem is a little difficult.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please let me see it.&rdquo; Mutsumi stared at the question. &ldquo;Oh my, it <em>is</em> hard. But there&rsquo;s no need to solve this difficult a problem. Something probably this advanced won&rsquo;t be on the test, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re trying to get into Todai, of course,&rdquo; Mutsumi added.</p>

  <p>An invisible sword pierced Motoko&rsquo;s heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O-o-of course, right,&rdquo; Motoko said. &ldquo;Ha ha ha.&rdquo; She forced a smile and laughed, but Naru was suddenly curious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, what college are you studying for, anyway?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Motoko gulped and said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Then she shuffled away.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Motoko entered the courtyard and stared into space. It was impossible for her to aim for Todai. She felt so embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Motoko knelt down and pulled open her shirt. &ldquo;I will just cause embarrassment by continuing fruitlessly! So I will end my life here!&rdquo; She pulled out a dagger&mdash;bent on committing ritual suicide. Again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well then, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Right when she was about to stab her stomach, the dagger she was holding slipped away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko&rsquo;s freed dagger floated in the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wh-what is going on&hellip;? Don&rsquo;t tell me that I studied so hard that I&rsquo;m hallucinating!&rdquo; Amid Motoko&rsquo;s confusion, she felt something dull hitting her on the back of the head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; She turned, but no one was there. Although she couldn&rsquo;t see anything, her specially trained senses told her there was something there. Well, her senses and a mysteriously floating dagger.</p>

  <p>A voice came from the void. &ldquo;Oh no! I guess you found me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Th-that voice&mdash;!&rdquo; Motoko gasped. The air slightly altered before her, and suddenly Kitsune appeared.</p>

  <p>It seemed a superfluous item, but on Kitsune&rsquo;s chest was a tiny, peculiar test unit called Stealth Mini, which was a simple optical camouflage mecha.</p>

  <p>Stealth Mini was the improved version of the Stealth Suit 2000 and one of the more practical things that Suu had made. The improvement was that instead of wearing a suit, the little mecha altered the area <em>around</em> the person to camouflage them.</p>

  <p>Suu and Sara also wore the same device on their chests and appeared moments later. The three of them were testing the new mecha.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko, here&rsquo;s your knife.&rdquo; Suu grinned and returned the dagger to Motoko. &ldquo;You were trying to commit suicide again, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of your business!&rdquo; Motoko snapped back.</p>

  <p>Kitsune teased her. &ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No thanks for the people who just saved your life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for your help!&rdquo; Motoko said, mortally embarrassed. Bad enough she was still disturbed by what happened in Naru&rsquo;s room but now this?</p>

  <p>But Kitsune kept up the torturous conversation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which college you&rsquo;re aiming for, but I can&rsquo;t drink if you keep causing trouble like this,&rdquo; she chided. &ldquo;That idiot Keitaro took three years to get in, but he didn&rsquo;t cause as much trouble as you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko winced, but Kitsune&rsquo;s next words wounded her deeper still. &ldquo;That idiot got into Todai!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The invisible sword stabbed Motoko in the heart again. She bit her lips in shame and ran away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Motoko!&rdquo; Kitsune called after her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chase her!&rdquo; Suu said, fiddling with her chest mecha.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold up, you two.&rdquo; Kitsune stopped the two girls.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you stop us?&rdquo; Sara asked. &ldquo;Are you sure we should leave Motoko alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune smiled back and said, &ldquo;Leave her be.&rdquo; Her facial expression was unusually gentle.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Motoko was by herself in a park. The sun was about to set, fading gold beams shooting into the purple twilight.</p>

  <p>In her mind, the sunset was overlapped by&hellip; Keitaro&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;Cripes!&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;If only I hadn&rsquo;t met you in the first place!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko kept her sword in its sheath and swung it around. She looked more like a child throwing a tantrum than a skilled swordswoman. Eventually, the sword smacked the frame of a swing set and the vibrations rippled through her whole body.</p>

  <p><em>How could I be so pathetic?</em> she thought, and became even more depressed. <em>Do I have any right to get so pissed at Kitsune?</em></p>

  <p>The answer, of course, was no. Getting teased about Keitaro wasn&rsquo;t a good feeling, but she had no right to hate Kitsune. Actually, the person she should hate was&hellip; herself. Or at least the special feelings she had locked away inside her own heart.</p>

  <p>Inside Motoko, it seemed, was <em>another</em> Motoko.</p>

  <p>She grew up as the successor of the Shinmei-ryu sword style, and she chose strength over beauty, and power over grace. She trained daily, but there was another Motoko inside that didn&rsquo;t agree with those militaristic ways. I was Keitaro who sparked the fire of this other, softer, hidden Motoko.</p>

  <p>She could see it all now&hellip;</p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Motoko, you&rsquo;re ever so beautiful today.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Urashima&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>Motoko couldn&rsquo;t help her throbbing heart when Keitaro looked into her eyes. Like a flower thirsting for water, she sought Keitaro. But no matter how many times she told her heart to be still, it was impossible to hold back the overflowing feelings.</em></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Urashima, I&hellip;&rdquo; Motoko&rsquo;s cheeks blushed as her lips pursed shut. She was too embarrassed to even finish the sentence.</em></p>

  <p><em>Keitaro gently embraced Motoko and said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to say it. I know what you want.&rdquo; And he looked deeply into her eyes.</em></p>

  <p><em>He had beautiful eyes. They were clear like the sky. She felt that he could look all the way into her very core. She know that she couldn&rsquo;t lie to his face. She was tied by chains of passion, and sought the pleasures of love. A weak, helpless love slave.</em></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Please&hellip; take me&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>Her voice trailed off and she trembled. Keitaro&rsquo;s muscular arms wrapped around her thin, delicate body. Her soft breasts were pressed against his chest. She was embarrassed, but the sensation ignited another fire within her.</em></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful, Motoko.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>Keitaro stroked Motoko&rsquo;s cheek. The firm yet comforting touch made her all the more excited. Keitaro&rsquo;s finger trailed down Motoko&rsquo;s neck and went lower.</em></p>

  <p class="cimg"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/dZPTIzM.jpg"></p>

  <p><em>Motoko could only imagine where all this would lead. It was immoral. But in front of this man, she could be shameless and have no regrets.</em></p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Motoko.&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p><em>Surprised, she looked at Keitaro. He smiled at her. Her heart raced. This was all so sudden, but she trusted him. So she smiled back and then closed her eyes. She could feel his warmth. Keitaro was closing in on her.</em></p>

  <p><em>She wanted this. She always had.</em></p>

  <p><em>Their lips touched</em>&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the heck am I doing?!&rdquo; Motoko shouted, coming to her senses.</p>

  <p>It was dark. The sun had already set. She had been daydreaming for quite some time. She was so shocked that she grabbed her sword, goose bumps rising up along her pale skin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Argh!&rdquo; she yelled, swinging her sword up and down frantically, as if to banish the evil thoughts.</p>

  <p>Then she heard an all-too-familiar voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, it is very reassuring to see that you still practice your sword skills in between your studies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko froze.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko tried to commit ritual suicide again?&rdquo; Naru asked Kitsune.</p>

  <p>Kitsune sounded oddly remorseful. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when I wanted her to fight back and let out some of her tension, I think I might have ended up hurting her feelings instead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune had become worried because Motoko still hadn&rsquo;t returned, so she sought advice. &ldquo;Tell me something,&rdquo; she asked Naru. &ldquo;Do you think Motoko will make it into college?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s aiming to get into, but maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean it doesn&rsquo;t matter what she chooses, since her hopes of getting into any college are thin?&rdquo; Kitsune became more worried.</p>

  <p>Naru fretted for a moment, but she remembered that Motoko was a strong swordswoman and said, &ldquo;Motoko should be just fine. Other than turtles, she&rsquo;s pretty invincible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought so, too, but you know,&rdquo; Kitsune said, &ldquo;life has three slopes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three slopes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The slope that goes uphill, the slope that goes downhill, and the slope that doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. Never mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bugging me now,&rdquo; Naru said. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune looked around. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell the others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru watched as Kitsune made a zipping motion across her lips. Confused, Naru just nodded.</p>

  <p>Kitsune paused for a bit and slowly opened her mouth. &ldquo;I tried to egg her on, but I might have added some of my true feelings in it,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Everyone was talking about college&mdash;like you, Keitaro, and that turtle-girl Mutsumi are in Todai&mdash;and now Shinobu and Motoko are studying for entrance exams. I kind of felt left behind, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; Naru was surprised at Kitsune&rsquo;s candor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, you guys don&rsquo;t mean to be exclusionary,&rdquo; Kitsune said. &ldquo;But with all of you talking about practice exam results, national rankings and stuff&hellip; I&rsquo;m not a part of that world, you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kitsune&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, maybe without even realizing it, I was getting disgusted about it, and maybe I took it out on Motoko&hellip;&rdquo; Kitsune smirked sadly.</p>

  <p>Naru placed her hand on Kitsune&rsquo;s shoulder and said, &ldquo;Shall we go find Motoko?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think we should look&mdash;for Motoko&rsquo;s and your sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune looked down. Her shoulder shook a bit&mdash;she seemed like she was crying. But when Kitsune raised her face, she was grinning madly, like she had pulled a fantastic prank. &ldquo;All righty then!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Naru blinked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the manager&rsquo;s approval! Let&rsquo;s hurry then. Let&rsquo;s wake up everyone and go find Motoko&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;W-wait&hellip; What?&rdquo; Naru was baffled, taken aback by Kitsune&rsquo;s quick recovery.</p>

  <p>The sly fox spoke over her shoulder. &ldquo;It would have been dangerous to confront Motoko by myself. I didn&rsquo;t want to go alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So your story&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a great actress, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; Kitsune said and winked. &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s meet downstairs in ten minutes. Don&rsquo;t be late now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru just stood there, stunned. But what Kitsune had said didn&rsquo;t seem like a lie&hellip; Naru shook her head and followed.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Ten minutes later, the residents of the Hinata House had gathered downstairs. Even though it was late at night, Kitsune was brimming with energy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All righty, everyone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go find Motoko!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yaaawn&hellip; &lsquo;kay.&rdquo; Shinobu was still half-asleep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna eat my bananas.&rdquo; Suu was still dreaming.</p>

  <p>Sara was leaning against Naru, snoring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Kitsune,&rdquo; Naru said. &ldquo;You and I should just go by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But they didn&rsquo;t have to go far to find the missing resident. The door opened, and Motoko came back, just like that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko! Where have you been all this time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; she began.</p>

  <p>But right when she started to talk, another voice came from behind her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We apologize. I haven&rsquo;t seen my Motoko for such a long time, so I wanted to have dinner with her, but we ended up talking for quite a while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko&rsquo;s older sister, Tsuruko, walked up the stairs. &ldquo;So nice to see everyone again,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Naru and Kitsune could only blink at Tsuruko&rsquo;s graceful accent.</p>

  <p class="pagination"><a href="05.html">&lt;&lt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html">^</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="07.html">&gt;&gt;</a></p>
