  <h2>Chapter 6: The Big Group Circle</h2>

  <p>Kitsune, still in Motoko&rsquo;s body, placed three fingers on the ground and bowed. She was clad in a white kimono and looked ethereally beautiful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Motoko, likewise in Kitsune&rsquo;s body, was also wearing a white kimono. She held a ceremonial sword. &ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s begin,&rdquo; she said, more than a little nervous.</p>

  <p>The futon was laid out in the middle of the room. The ritual table stood near the futon&rsquo;s pillows. On top of the table rested the sakaki tree branches. The Living Souls Exchange spell-breaking was about to begin.</p>

  <p>The lights were turned off, and the girls' silhouettes were the only things visible in the darkened room. The rustling of moving cloth and their stilted breaths were all that filled the silence, though Motoko swore she could hear their heartbeats.</p>

  <p>They silently slipped out of their kimonos. Now completely naked, they climbed into the futon according to the ancient book&rsquo;s instructions, and then they each grabbed the sheath of the sword.</p>

  <p>Those were the rigid steps of the instructions. The two girls, feeling slightly relived that they&rsquo;d managed to get it right so far, started to talk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This has been a very long day,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune whispered.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko nodded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t thing that the club would be that hectic,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>The Rabbit and Turtle club had overflowed with customers&mdash;owing in no small part to the fact that the girls had worn sexy bunny outfits. Some of the first guests had called their friends on cell phones and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some cute girls in this club,&rdquo; and the number of customers quickly doubled. As word spread, even more customers came, so the girls became extremely busy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those kinds of clubs earn money from word of mouth,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why popular clubs stay successful and poor one lose customers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that how it goes?&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune asked.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko nodded. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just like file, I guess,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Successful people are always successful. Unsuccessful people are always out of luck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was not a happy thought for Motoko. &ldquo;So unsuccessful people can&rsquo;t ever be successful?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Any person can come across a stroke of luck or two in their life. It&rsquo;s like making a bet. Maybe taking the college entrance exam is one of those chances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune thought about that. &ldquo;Did you ever take that kind of chance, Kitsune?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me? My chance&hellip; is now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something rustled under the covers. Motoko-Kitsune felt something touching her, which was really weird, since it meant she felt her own fingers touching Kitsune&rsquo;s body, but she was the touch-ee rather than the touch-er.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;H-hey, what are you doing!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m touching myself, silly,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said. &ldquo;I can do that to my own body if I want to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;B-but&hellip; not when <em>I&rsquo;m</em> you!&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune replied, squirming. Actually, it felt kind of nice. Motoko&rsquo;s fingers, guided by Kitsune&rsquo;s will, seemed very confident, way more experienced at this kind of thing than Motoko ever dreamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Motoko,&rdquo; Kitsune whispered. &ldquo;How about we two girls have some fun?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t have any interest in that,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said, blushing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just kidding.&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko giggled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke, dummy. Did you take me seriously?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune was confused now, and feeling all kinds of weird things. &ldquo;I, uh&hellip;&rdquo; she fumbled. &ldquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get mad,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what can I do to make it up to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko thought about it. This crazy night, for all its scary moments, was actually kind of fun. Certainly wilder than anything she would ever have tried by herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I make it into college,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune asked, &ldquo;will you take me out to party?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko smiled; her white teeth were visible even in the darkened room. &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to a really great club.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I look forward to that,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said gleefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to educate you on adult life. You might have a hard time of it at first, but&hellip; after being in your body today, I realized how hard it is to study for college. In that sense, I respect Naru, Shinobu, and even that stupid boy, Keitaro.&rdquo; She paused a moment. &ldquo;And of course, I really respect you too, Motoko.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Only the sound of soft snores.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko, did you fell asleep already?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Motoko-Kitsune only snored in reply. Kitsune-Motoko snuggled up to her, then took her hand from under the covers and stroked Motoko&rsquo;s face&hellip; or rather, she stroked her own face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live my life,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be back in this body, so please take care of it and rest well.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Motoko saw a nostalgic face in her dream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko, how are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Square glasses and ruffled hair. He was wearing dull clothes and laughing. He was goofy and awkward as always, but still&hellip; it was Keitaro.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Urashima&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re studying to get into college, right? You&rsquo;ll do fine, Motoko,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Urashima, the college I&rsquo;m trying to get into is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you, okay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko smiled and nodded. And when she ran to Keitaro, she jumped into his arms. Somehow, she <em>knew</em> that it was a dream. But at least in her dreams, she wanted to be true to her feelings.</p>

  <p>She felt Keitaro&rsquo;s warmth.</p>

  <p>And inside her heart, she felt a warm spring breeze.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>A few days after Motoko and Kitsune had returned to their respective bodies, the weather turned warm and sunny. Spring was just around the corner.</p>

  <p>Naru swept the yard. Motoko smiled as she walked by.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? You seem to be in a good mood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I talked with Kitsune,&rdquo; Motoko replied. &ldquo;I appreciated the thought, but I declined her offer to do the &lsquo;old switcheroo&rsquo; with you to pass the entrance exam.&rdquo; She smiled as if a great load had been taken from her shoulders. &ldquo;My chances of passing the exam by myself might be lower, but I want to see how far I can go on my own. I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru smiled at Motoko and nodded. &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Motoko nodded back.</p>

  <p>Naru thought about Keitaro during his study years. Then she realized, maybe Motoko was aiming for&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mail!&rdquo; A young mailman cut off Naru&rsquo;s thoughts. She turned and accepted it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Naru had received a postcard, but didn&rsquo;t recognize the woman&rsquo;s name on it. She looked on the backside and was startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Naru?&rdquo; Motoko asked.</p>

  <p>Just then, Kitsune appeared. &ldquo;What a great day!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good day to gamble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Kitsune!&rdquo; Naru seemed angry and glared at the cheeky fox.</p>

  <p>Motoko tilted her head&mdash;she had no idea what was going on. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is from Rabbit and Turtle!&rdquo; Naru replied. The postcard said that the club was hectic with so many new customers. It also said that the pay for Naru and the girls' work was already deposited into Kitsune&rsquo;s bank account.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What money?&rdquo; Naru asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oops! Th-that&rsquo;s&hellip;!&rdquo; Kitsune went pale.</p>

  <p>Motoko also closed in on her. &ldquo;So the truth comes out. &lsquo;Mama&rsquo; was never going to kill herself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cornered, Kitsune blurted out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll double the money and give it to you!&rdquo; And then she fled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Kitsune!&rdquo; Naru cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go after her!&rdquo; Motoko suggested.</p>

  <p>The two girls chased after Kitsune.</p>

  <p>In the commotion, Naru dropped the postcard and it fluttered to the ground. On it was a photo of the three girls in bunny suits. Kitsune and Motoko stood beside Naru, making peace signs and laughing.</p>

  <p>They both had great smiles.</p>
