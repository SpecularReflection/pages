  <h2>Chapter 5: Let&rsquo;s Go Party!</h2>

  <p>Motoko, in Kitsune&rsquo;s body, nervously entered the downtown area. Naru walked cautiously beside her.</p>

  <p>There were neon signs everywhere; male employees tried to lure customers into seedy clubs and female hostesses strutted around provocatively. Because the end of the year was drawing close, many businessmen were hanging around after their year-end parties, looking for a good spot for a second round of drinks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will we be able to find Kitsune?&rdquo; Motoko asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I think I might know where she is,&rdquo; Naru reassured.</p>

  <p>Doing the laundry was one of the manager&rsquo;s duties, or rather, the substitute manager&rsquo;s duties. She needed to check for items in the pockets before throwing clothes in the wash. There were several matchboxes with specific clubs' names that always came out of Kitsune&rsquo;s pockets. After doing the laundry for a while, Naru had simply memorized the names.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can only count on your memory, Naru,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said.</p>

  <p>If they couldn&rsquo;t switch back tonight, Tsuruko&rsquo;s severe punishment awaited Motoko, so Motoko lowered her head and silently prayed that they&rsquo;d find that sly fox.</p>

  <p>First they checked out a casual restaurant, then a sports bar, but Kitsune-Motoko was nowhere to be seen. The third place was a local bar, but it had been closed down for two weeks.</p>

  <p>The fourth place was called The Fancy Madam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What type of place is this?&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Naru said. &ldquo;The matchbox only had the name on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two girls desperately searched for The Fancy Madam. They had no time to waste.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When they opened the door a young man who looked like Brad Pitt approached them. Naru and Motoko-Kitsune braced themselves.</p>

  <p>They had found The Fancy Madam. It didn&rsquo;t look so glamorous on the outside, but the inside was absolutely dazzling. The place had twinkling lights and young, hunky guys&mdash;barely legal, it seemed&mdash;in handsome suits all lined up to greet them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> this place?!&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune gasped, just overwhelmed at the sight.</p>

  <p>Naru wasn&rsquo;t as surprised as Motoko, though. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a host club!&rdquo; she said. Naru knew that these kinds of places existed, but this was the first time she&rsquo;d ever been in one.</p>

  <p>The buff young male employees went wild as soon as they saw Motoko, thinking she was actually Kitsune. &ldquo;Kitsune, welcome back! Please come in!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you brought someone with you? Please come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Um, we&rsquo;re looking for someone&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The employees didn&rsquo;t listen and literally dragged them into the club. Apparently, Kitsune was one of their regular customers. They happily greeted the girls.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, Kitsune!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welcome, Kitsune!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please come this way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The one who first greeted them (who really did look like Brat Pitt) showed them to a large booth. The other boys came, took a knee, offered a warm hand towel, and said hello. Naru and Motoko hesitated, but since the boys stayed in that position, they ended up taking the towels.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Brad&rsquo; came back with a bottle. &ldquo;Kitsune, our normal greeting,&rdquo; he said, and touched Kitsune-Motoko&rsquo;s breast with his right hand.</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune was shocked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a freebie,&rdquo; Brad said with a wink, placing his other hand on her other breast.</p>

  <p>Next, he touched Naru&rsquo;s breasts. Naru twitched a little.</p>

  <p>But it was weird&mdash;even though a strange guy was feeling them up, Naru and Motoko somehow didn&rsquo;t feel offended. When the Brad Pitt look-alike saw Naru&rsquo;s puzzled expression, he said, &ldquo;Oh no, Kitsune. You should have explained to your friend what this place is like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune replied.</p>

  <p>The young man explained, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaking our club for a host club, right? But it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Naru said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All our employees are female.&rdquo; He winked again. It took a moment to sink in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Naru raised her voice in surprise.</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune was about to freak out, too. They looked at the beautiful boy&mdash;no, girl. Upon closer inspection, all the guys here did seem more delicate than a normal male, and they moved with a certain grace.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Brad&rsquo; was a girl too, so Naru and Motoko didn&rsquo;t feel all that offended by her touch. They breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s take a break and have some drinks,&rdquo; Naru suggested.</p>

  <p>Naru had become curious, but Motoko was still a bit uncomfortable&mdash;on the surface. Actually, she was very excited about this first experience but didn&rsquo;t have the courage to express that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, this place isn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; she began, then stopped. It was then that she remembered her sister&rsquo;s comment.</p>

  <p><em>Motoko is too stiff</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Motoko took a deep breath. She did not look like Motoko Aoyama right now. She was Kitsune&mdash;wild, exciting, crazy Kitsune. If she couldn&rsquo;t change herself now, then when?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a break, okay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko?&rdquo; Naru began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Motoko,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;As you can see, I&rsquo;m Kitsune.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko-Kitsune grinned just like Kitsune would, but the smile still had some of Motoko in it.</p>

  <p>Naru smiled back. The two decided to rest for a while. Naru drank a rum and soda, and Motoko-Kitsune ordered some hot Japanese tea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kitsune, do you have a hangover again?&rdquo; the Brad-girl chided. Fortunately, even though Motoko ordered hot tea, no one was suspicious of her real identity.</p>

  <p>They spent about an hour there chatting with the guys&hellip; or rather, the girls. The conversations sounded like girls' locker room talk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talking about all kinds of things at this sort of club is kinda fun,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune remarked.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the karaoke started a song that had recently topped the charts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started!&rdquo; A girl from a different booth whooped and ran to the stage.</p>

  <p>Motoko recognized that figure. She was wearing a micro-miniskirt and an angora sweater. And of course, she sported Motoko&rsquo;s own face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naru! There! It&rsquo;s Kitsune!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko held the microphone.</p>

  <p>Naru tried to call out, but Motoko-Kitsune suddenly stopped her. &ldquo;Why, Motoko?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please let me watch for a bit,&rdquo; she whispered shyly. Her eyes twinkled brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen me like this! I want to see how I enjoy myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Up on the little stage, Kitsune was singing and entertaining everyone while in Motoko&rsquo;s body. The employees rang tambourines and bells and cheered her on. Kitsune was happy, and she even did some dance moves during the song.</p>

  <p>Motoko looked at her own body and was reminded of her older sister&rsquo;s smile, back when they were children and more carefree with each other.</p>

  <p>Motoko was also reminded of Tsuruko&rsquo;s words: <em>Motoko needs to open her heart&hellip; She needs to smile like a warm spring breeze&hellip;</em></p>

  <p>After Kitsune-Motoko finished the song, there was loud applause.</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune slowly stood up. &ldquo;Motoko, we&rsquo;ve come for you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Motoko&mdash;&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko was taken by surprise; she looked worried that the girls might be angry.</p>

  <p>But Motoko-Kitsune just smiled and said sincerely, &ldquo;I really saw something good today. I feel like a warm spring breeze.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This new Motoko was very nice to see.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Naru and the girls didn&rsquo;t return to the Hinata House right away.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko asked for a favor. &ldquo;Cal I please go to just one more place? Please!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh, Kitsune, didn&rsquo;t you have enough fun already?&rdquo; Naru asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that. It&rsquo;s to help someone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>According to Kitsune-Motoko, a female friend was having trouble with her business. If she didn&rsquo;t raise enough money on sales tonight, she would lose her club, and maybe her life, too.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you go straight to the club?&rdquo; Naru asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, I was in this tight, young body. I wanted to have some fun with it, you know?&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune remarked.</p>

  <p>With a troubled look, Kitsune-Motoko pleaded, &ldquo;Just one hour. If you can help me for just one hour, I&rsquo;ll go back. Please?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other girls traded glances. &ldquo;What should we do, Motoko?&rdquo; Naru asked.</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune thought about it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if a life is in danger,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we cannot just ignore it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right! That&rsquo;s what I would have said,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, Kitsune. What kind of place is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The name is Usagi to Kame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kame&hellip;&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune muttered. She didn&rsquo;t like that name at all.</p>

  <p>Usagi no Kame, on the end of the entertainment district, was an expensive looking club. The real name was Rabbit and Turtle but Kitsune just called it <em>Usagi to Kame</em>.</p>

  <p>The sign had a rabbit and turtle on it, and for some reason, the turtle looked just like Tama.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hating this even more with every step,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune lamented.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about hating this place,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said confidently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the customers are turtle,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wha&hellip;?!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just kidding. That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heeey! It&rsquo;s a joke, a joke!&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko teased. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t get mad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru smoothed it over by saying, &ldquo;This might be an interesting place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko led them inside. The interior was very classy, with soft jazz music playing, but there were no customers inside. Not only that, but there weren&rsquo;t any employees, either.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee, where did Mama go?&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko wondered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this a letter for you?&rdquo; Naru asked, indicating a memo on the far end of the counter.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko read it and uttered, &ldquo;Oh shoot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mama went home because no one came here tonight. At this rate, she might really commit suicide. Oh gosh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if her life is on the line, then we&rsquo;ll have to do something,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run the place tonight and see what we can come up with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Naru blinked, surprised. She looked at Kitsune-Motoko &ldquo;I sure didn&rsquo;t expect her to say that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune, now full of surprises, just chuckled.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Five minutes later, Motoko-Kitsune was almost in tears. &ldquo;Are you crazy?!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wear this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said. &ldquo;These are the only uniforms available.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The item in question was a very skimpy Playboy Bunny outfit, cut low, easily a thousand times sexier than anything Motoko had ever dreamed of donning. Kitsune-Motoko finished zipping her up and twirled her around in front of the mirror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eek!&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune cried, and covered her eyes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well. it&rsquo;s that&hellip; or this!&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko said, hauling up a Tama-like turtle outfit, possibly used for parties or Halloween.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate that one even more!&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune yelled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then stop complaining and wear the bunny suit,&rdquo; Naru said, as she came out of the locker room with her bunny outfit already on. She wiggled, adjusting her cleavage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tight in the chest&hellip;&rdquo; she complained.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko wolf whistled. &ldquo;Naru you look great.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heh heh&hellip; I actually wanted to try on an outfit like this, at least once.&rdquo; Naru giggled and wiggled her little tail.</p>

  <p>She really looked great. Her fishnet stockings and firm breasts made her look more mature, yet the bunny ears gave her a playful quality. Even other girls thought that she was sexy. Heck, people in comes probably would, too. She could make plankton drool.</p>

  <p>Kitsune-Motoko urged Motoko-Kitsune on. &ldquo;Come on, Motoko. You know you wanna try it on, too,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s my body, so what are you worried about, right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; It was a good point. Motoko-Kitsune didn&rsquo;t have an answer for that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko added, &ldquo;this place isn&rsquo;t the sleazy kind that lets customers grab the employees. Maybe that&rsquo;s why it does such lousy business. But I promise you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think about it. You look like me now, Motoko. So there isn&rsquo;t anything to be ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune turned and caught a glimpse of her butt in the mirror&hellip; or rather, Kitsune&rsquo;s butt. She wiggled it. It looked pretty cure, she had to admit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I guess&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Motoko was ready, Kitsune knew. She needed one more push to make the move.</p>

  <p>Kitsune leaned close and whispered in her ear, <em>&ldquo;The Monthly Amore?&rdquo;</em></p>

  <p>Motoko-Kitsune blushed and narrowed her eyes, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>And so&hellip;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; The voices of the three girls rang out through the club. Motoko and Kitsune looked at each other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, I guess I don&rsquo;t look to bad,&rdquo; Motoko-Kitsune said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look like a total stranger,&rdquo; Kitsune-Motoko teased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Motoko, you&rsquo;re Motoko.&rdquo; Naru smiled, so Motoko and Kitsune smiled back. The red brass bell at the entrance rang, and the first customers arrived.</p>
