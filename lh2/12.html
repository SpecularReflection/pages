  <h2>Chapter 7: Bayside Christmas</h2>

  <p>Tiny snowflakes were falling in the bayside town of Yokohama. The city was decorated with festive, twinkling lights, and the air was filled with the Christmas spirit.</p>

  <p>The Hinata House residents were near the Marine Tower. It was all lit up and looked like a big candle, drawing the crowd&rsquo;s attention.</p>

  <p>But Naru and the girls looked out to the bay, which was pleasantly illuminated by the city lights.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Urashima is on the other side of this ocean?&rdquo; Shinobu asked, her breath puffing out into the cold air. She had tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if that idiot is doing all right,&rdquo; Sara said a little sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder what sort of Christmas he&rsquo;s having,&rdquo; Suu said, looking far off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Knowing him, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s not having much of a Christmas at all.&rdquo; Kitsune laughed, but she also looked a little depressed, in her own way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe he forgot that it&rsquo;s Christmas,&rdquo; Mutsumi said, smiling as ever. Tama say on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he is studying in the United States. Christmas is big there,&rdquo; Motoko answered, deliberately looking at anything other than Tama.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting cold, guys. Shall we go back?&rdquo; Naru suggested.</p>

  <p>A large ferry nearby suddenly blew its horn, making everyone cover their ears.</p>

  <p>Naru, looking back out to the sea, yelled, &ldquo;Hurry up and come back, you pervert!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She knew that when the little snowflakes in the air turned into cherry blossoms, Keitaro would return.</p>

  <p>Somehow, that still felt like a long time to wait.</p>
